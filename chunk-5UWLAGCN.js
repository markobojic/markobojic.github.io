This was the third attempt to migrate a complex legacy system built on Silverlight to a modern Angular-based solution. Two teams had already tried and failed. The task ahead wasn't just about migration\u2014it was about rebuilding trust, creating clarity, and setting the project on a solid foundation.

Our first step was to dig deep into the legacy codebase and the remnants of the previous migration attempts. The system was a tangled web of undocumented, bug-ridden code. To make matters worse, we had no detailed requirements\u2014just a high-level understanding of what the application was supposed to do and a client's initial six-month timeline for the migration. It was immediately apparent that the journey would be far more complex than anticipated.

We started by organizing technical analysis sessions. Our QA team supported these efforts by writing BDD tests, which were crucial for reverse-engineering the system's functionality. Piece by piece, we documented the critical workflows and identified the features that needed migration. This documentation became our migration roadmap and the foundation for our strategy.

On the technical front, we made some key architectural decisions to set the project up for success. We established the front-end as an NX Monorepo. This choice allowed us to break the application into manageable modules, enabling better scalability and collaboration. Meanwhile, the back-end team created REST APIs to expose the necessary endpoints. We used Swagger to ensure team collaboration with clear and accessible API documentation.

As we delved deeper into the project, it became evident that the six-month timeline was unrealistic. We presented a detailed plan to the client, explaining that a two-year timeline was more appropriate for the scope of work. Despite the shock, the client appreciated our transparency and used the revised timeline to adjust their planning and budgeting.

Within six months, we delivered a stable version of the application with critical features migrated. This milestone was significant for us and the client, who finally had a functional foundation they could build on. While resource constraints eventually led the client to pause the project, we left them with a clear roadmap for completing the migration and a deep understanding of the effort required.

Looking back, the project was more than a technical migration. It was a lesson in resilience, collaboration, and the power of a well-coordinated team. As one of the client's managers put it: "Marko was a great fit in balancing best practices and sustainability with business needs. Despite a noisy and challenging environment, he remained objective, pragmatic, and sympathetic to the legacy application's risks. His team rebuilt from scratch after the previous vendor's work, delivering a stable foundation under difficult circumstances."

During this time, I maintained close ties to the index management project and the reusable UI library initiative I had championed as a Senior Associate.

The migration project provided valuable lessons in scalable architecture, particularly with the adoption of NX Monorepo. Recognizing the potential of this approach, I proposed applying the same architecture to the index management solution. Working closely with the most senior developer on the team, we devised a detailed plan to restructure the project using NX Monorepo and micro-frontends via module federation. By this point, the index management project had grown significantly, incorporating additional applications alongside the UI library, and required a more scalable and maintainable structure.

When I rejoined the index management team after completing the migration work, I found that the strong architectural foundations we had laid had been successfully implemented. These foundations enabled the project to operate more efficiently, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for one of the most demanding industries in the world.

Today, I continue contributing to the index management project, leveraging our modular architecture and collaborative team dynamics to deliver solutions that meet and exceed client expectations.

Initially, it was just the two of us setting up the architecture, estimating tasks, and laying the groundwork for the project. Over time, our front-end team grew to four developers, and we continued refining and expanding the system to meet the client's needs.

I identified an opportunity to enhance efficiency and consistency across applications early in the project. I proposed the creation of a reusable UI library that could serve our project and other teams and applications within the client's ecosystem. Built with Storybook, the library enabled isolated testing of UI components, streamlining development and improving reliability. This initiative became a cornerstone for a unified and scalable approach to front-end development within the organization.

As the project evolved, the scope expanded, and we became part of a larger effort involving two separate teams that were later merged into a cohesive unit of approximately 30 members. This included back-end developers, QA engineers, DevOps specialists, business analysts, engineering managers, product managers, and designers. The integration brought challenges but also opened immense opportunities for collaboration and innovation.

After six months of contributing to the project's foundation and success, I was promoted to leadership, transitioning to work on a critical migration project for the same client.

It was during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more time on my hands, I finally decided to take action. I started by publishing programming tutorials on YouTube, aiming to introduce children to coding concepts in an engaging and approachable way. The positive feedback from parents and kids was encouraging and confirmed that I was on the right track. It also motivated me to elevate this initiative into a platform.

I began developing the website and structuring the course plan. I designed the curriculum to ensure a smooth learning journey for children, starting with introductory courses. It was structured into four levels\u2014Scratch Intro, Zero, Rookie, and Pro\u2014to guide children from basic concepts to more advanced programming techniques. One of my proudest achievements was making the Intro course completely free, allowing all children to access the basics of Scratch programming regardless of their parents financial situation.

I also had ambitious plans for the future of Programarko, envisioning additional courses covering web development, Python, artificial intelligence, game development, and more.

Creating high-quality content was a major challenge, as I handled every aspect of production myself\u2014from recording and editing videos to publishing them online. Over time, I developed over 400 short, engaging videos that explained programming concepts in a way children could easily understand and enjoy. To promote Programarko, I ran email and social media campaigns, creating video teasers to spark interest. However, it wasn't always easy to convince parents that children could effectively learn programming online rather than through traditional classroom settings.

Despite these challenges, Programarko gained traction. I partnered with companies like Novalite and collaborated with STEM Classroom to host a webinar for 1,200 school teachers, showcasing the platform's potential to make programming education accessible to children across Serbia. Programarko grew to approximately 1,000 users through these efforts, proving that the concept resonated with its target audience.

Unfortunately, as much as I loved working on Programarko, the limited market size in Serbia and my increasing professional responsibilities eventually led me to put the project on hold. However, I'm not done with it yet. I plan to publish all the content on YouTube shortly, making it freely available to children everywhere.

Programarko remains one of my most meaningful projects, reflecting my passion for education and commitment to making programming accessible to the next generation, especially in smaller communities where opportunities are rare.
